# Function to compare the UI usuario answer and those from LPG in the case of no exact match
def are_dicts_similar(dict1, dict2, threshold):
    '''
   This function compares two dictionaries to determine their similarity based on common key-value pairs.

   Parameters
   ----------
   dict1 : dict
       The first dictionary for comparison.
   dict2 : dict
       The second dictionary for comparison.
   threshold : int
       The threshold of similarity, indicating the minimum number of common elements.

   Returns
   -------
   bool
       True if the number of common elements is equal to or greater than the threshold, False otherwise.
   '''
    common_elements = sum(1 for key, value in dict1.items() if key in dict2 and dict2[key] == value)
    return common_elements >= threshold


def lpg_electricity_profile_generator(ruta_jsons, ruta_csvs, answer):
    '''
    This function generates an electricity consumption profile based on user input and available data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ruta_jsons : str
        The path to the folder containing JSON files with household specifications.
    ruta_csvs : str
        The path to the folder containing CSV files with electricity consumption profiles.
    answer : dict
        A dictionary representing user input specifying household characteristics.

    Returns
    -------
    np.array
        An array representing the electricity consumption profile.

    Notes
    -----
    This function attempts to match the user input with available household specifications and assigns the corresponding electricity consumption profile.
    If no exact match is found, it offers three options:
    1. Assign a random profile from available data.
    2. Assign the closest matching profile.
    3. Assign the average of all available profiles.

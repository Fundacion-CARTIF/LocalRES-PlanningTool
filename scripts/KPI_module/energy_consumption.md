# Energy Consumption Module: `energy_consumption.py`

## Overview
`energy_consumption.py` is a Python module that calculates the energy consumption for buildings based on predefined generation system profiles and demand data. It processes heating, cooling, domestic hot water (DHW), and electricity demand to determine consumption using fuel yield values.

This module plays a key role in energy analysis, allowing for the calculation of energy demand across different building profiles.

## Features
- **Energy Consumption Calculation**: Computes energy consumption for heating, cooling, DHW, and electricity based on demand profiles.
- **Fuel Yield Consideration**: Uses predefined fuel yield values to estimate energy needs for different systems.
- **Building Profile Integration**: Reads data from building statistics profiles to determine system configurations.
- **Dynamic Consumption Processing**: Iterates through multiple buildings to generate individualized consumption outputs.

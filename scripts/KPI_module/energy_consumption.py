Explanation of the script:

1- Accessing Database Information:
The function generation_system_function accesses the database to retrieve the parameters needed to calculate consumption and creates a dictionary for each system:
generation_system_profile = {
    "heating_system": {
        "system_type": EC_type,
        "fuel_yield_1": FY_1,
        "fuel_yield_2": FY_2,
    } 
}
Calling the energy_consumption Function:
The dictionary {} is passed to the energy_consumption function, where it first filters the type of system being processed and patches it if the corresponding demand exists in the demand profile.
Example:
    if 'heating_system' in generation_system_profile and 'heating_demand' in demand_profile:
    If this condition is true, consumption is calculated using fuel_yield_1 and the demand profile.

Assumption: All cases of generation_system have fuel_yield_2 = 0, except for CHP systems. However, no baseline case is derived from this technology, so filtering for fuel_yield_2 is not applied.

Returning to generation_system_function:
Once the consumption profile is calculated, the script returns to the generation_system_function to save the profile and continue with the next system.

The function ultimately returns:
building_consumption_dict[f"building_id_{i+1}"] = {    
    "elec_consumption": electricity_consumption,
    "heat_consumption": heating_consumption,
    "cool_consumption": cooling_consumption,
    "dhw_consumption": dhw_consumption,
    "generation_system_profile_id": generation_system_profile_id 
}

def energy_consumption_function(fuel_yield1,demand_profile_list):
    '''
    This function calculates the energy consumption for different systems based on the provided generation system profiles and demand profiles.
    It iterates through each system in the generation system profile and checks if the corresponding demand exists in the demand profile. If the demand is present, it calculates the energy consumption using the fuel yield values of the respective systems.

    For heating demand:
    - It checks if heating demand is present in the generation system profile.
    - If present, it calculates the heating consumption based on the fuel yield for heating.
    - Then, it extends the consumption list with the calculated heating consumption.

    For DHW demand:
    - It checks if DHW demand is present in the generation system profile.
    - If present, it calculates the DHW consumption based on the fuel yield for DHW.
    - Then, it extends the consumption list with the calculated DHW consumption.

    For electricity demand:
    - It checks if electricity demand is present in the generation system profile.
    - If present, it calculates the electricity consumption based on the fuel yield for electricity.
    - Then, it extends the consumption list with the calculated electricity consumption.

    For cooling demand:
    - It checks if cooling demand is present in the generation system profile.
    - If present, it calculates the cooling consumption based on the fuel yield for cooling.
    - Then, it extends the consumption list with the calculated cooling consumption.

    Finally, it returns the list of consumption values for each generation system.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fuel_yiel1 : float
        efficiency (or fuel yield) of the heating, cooling, electricity, and DHW systems.

    demand_profile_list : dict
        A list with one demand profiles: heating, cooling, electricity, and DHW needs

    Returns
    -------
    consumption_per_generation_system : list
        A list containing the calculated energy consumption values for each generation system.
